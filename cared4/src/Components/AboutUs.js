              The Idea of Cared4 came a few years ago when I got very sick and
              googled my symptoms. The results were that I had kidney failure
              and only had a few months to live. Considering I’m still here, I
              determined their diagnosis was inaccurate. This is where I decided
              to develop a tool so people can confidently diagnose their
              sicknesses from home.

              Cared4 is the next best self-diagnosing personal care tool. Users
              can utilize Cared4 to search for their symptoms and get a
              diagnosis instantly without doctoral consultation. The application
              will be optimized to be incredibly user-friendly, making care
              accessible to everyone. Simply inputting a user’s symptoms into
              the search bar will start their diagnosis as the Cared4 algorithm
              will quickly provide results illustrating to the user what they
              most likely have. Whereas other self-diagnosing software displays
              every result no matter how terrifying, Cared4 will keep the user
              calm by placing rare conditions separate from what they most
              likely have. Cared4 will also have the capability to be
              personalized. Users will be given the option to add personal
              information such as pre-existing conditions, age, and gender to
              their profile, which can give them more accurate results when
              searching for their symptoms. Personalization will also help
              Cared4’s algorithm determine how severe an illness is. For
              example, if a user has undergone chemotherapy, a sickness like
              pneumonia is much more severe than usual. The goal of this
              application is to bring reliable healthcare to everybody.
              Sometimes visiting a doctor can be a daunting task. Whether it’s
              too expensive or too time-consuming, it can be a hassle. Cared4
              brings the doctor to your phone, so you can get results whenever
              is most convenient for free. Providing help wherever possible is
              how Cared4 brings healthcare into the 21st century.
