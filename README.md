### What is Cared4?
Cared4 is the next best self-diagnosing personal care tool. Users can utilize Cared4 to search for their symptoms and get a diagnosis instantly without doctoral consultation. The application is optimized to be incredibly user-friendly, making care accessible to everyone. Simply inputting a user’s symptoms into the search bar will start their diagnosis as the Cared4 algorithm will quickly provide results illustrating to the user what they most likely have. Whereas other self-diagnosing software displays every result no matter how terrifying, Cared4 will keep the user calm by placing rare conditions separate from what they most likely have. Cared4 will also have the capability to be personalized. Users will be given the option to add personal information such as pre-existing conditions, age, and gender to their profile, which can give them more accurate results when searching for their symptoms. Personalization will also help Cared4’s algorithm determine how severe an illness is. For example, if a user has undergone chemotherapy, a sickness like pneumonia is much more severe than usual. The goal of this application is to bring reliable healthcare to everybody. Sometimes visiting a doctor can be a daunting task. Whether it’s too expensive or too time-consuming, it can be a hassle. Cared4 brings the doctor to your phone, so you can get results whenever is most convenient for free. Providing help wherever possible is how Cared4 brings healthcare into the 21st century.
